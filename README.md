# **DSFR** Components for LWR Experience Sites

## Introduction

This package contains a set of configurable  LWC component implementing various
HTML components defined in the French Government Design System
([Système de Design de l'État](https://www.systeme-de-design.gouv.fr/))
for Salesforce Experience Sites.

⚠️ These components aim at reproducing as well as possible the expected DSFR Page 
Layout and Styling within **LWR Build Your Own** template based Experience Sites.   

⚠️ This is a first draft version which will progressively enhanced and extended
for a first live implementation.

These components are built/maintained as contributions/examples for ongoing Advisory assignments by 
[Pierre-Emmanuel Gros](https://github.com/pegros). Please reach out if you want to contribute to
this initiative.

⚠️ This package is based on the v1.7.2 release of the DSFR (see [here](https://www.systeme-de-design.gouv.fr/comment-utiliser-le-dsfr/developpeurs/prise-en-main-du-dsfr) to download a newer version).

## Package Content

It provides different sets of LWC Components:
* Pure layout components (accordion and tabs of sections)
* Complex Components (header and footer implementing responsibe)
* Aggregated Components (card, tiles, alerts...)
* Individual Display Components (tags, buttons...)

## Technical Details

These components leverage the latest capabilities of LWR Experience Sites and will probably not
work in Aura based ones.

A wide number of components are also usable within Flows in order to be reused for 
Page Flow processes within Experience Sites.
